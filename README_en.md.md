## WORKSAMPLE Answer questions online

You will answer questions on DIVER in the real work.

### Example

`Question example`

```
I want to check my understanding of the difference between f.text_field and f.hidden_field
Is the following correct?

f.text_field　→　Shows the text in editable state
f.hidden_field　→　Shows the text in uneditable state
```

`Answer Example`

```
You are almost correst, but I will add some points!

f.text_field　→　Shows the text in editable state（Shows the box part to type text in. Whether the box already has the text from the beginning depends on the arguments passed for form_for statement）

f.hidden_field　→　Includes the data such as text carried with the commands such as controller in the current page. (You cannot see and uneditable）
```

### Let's answer

`Question`

```
This is an explanation on the proper use of "single" and "plural" in Rails.

For example, "blogs" is specified for the parameter when the controller is created, and "blog" is specified when the model is created, respectively. Various variables are automatically created based on that, so I think "blogs" and "blog" should be used differently, but I am confused because there is no description about it anywhere.

When I try "rake routes", there are also "blog" "new_blog" "blogs" and "confirm_blogs" in the Prefix, and I do not understand why.
```
